# 2024 HPCTESTATHON
## HPC System Testing Workshop (with hands-on)

## Details
* **When**: 3-4 May, 2024, held in conjunction with [CUG 2024](https://cug.org/cug-2024/).
* **Where**: Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, 1 Bryce Avenue, Kensington 6151, Western Australia

## Description

This workshop brings together HPC experts and vendors from around the globe to share state-of-the-art HPC system testing methodologies, tools, benchmarks, tests, procedures, and best practices. The increasing complexity of HPC architectures requires a larger number of tests in order to thoroughly evaluate the status of the system after its installation or before a software upgrade is applied to production systems. Therefore, HPC centers and vendors use different methodologies to evaluate their systems during its lifetime, not only at the beginning during the installation and acceptance time, but also regularly during maintenance windows.

### Goal

The overall goal of this event is to establish a common and open HPC system test suite based on recommendations from the participants.

### Focus

The focus of the event will be on hands-on experience with open source tests shared by supercomputing sites (more information in "Data and code sharing" section below). Access to Pawsey's Setonix supercomputer will be made available for the participants to experiment with various tests to review their scope, usefullness and readiness for including in the HPC test suite.

Workshop will be focusing on:
* Basic scheduler and programming environment tests,
* Node health tests,
* Application-based regression tests,
* Various isolated system components tests, including interconnect, filesystem, memory, CPUs and GPUs.
