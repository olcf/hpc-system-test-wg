# Welcome to the System Test Working Group

This working group is a new effort started as a result of a Birds-of-a-Feather session at the Cray User Group 2019. The main goals for this working group are:
1. Share acceptance and regression test procedures.
1. Learn about tools successfully used for testing at various HPC centers.
1. Compile a list of resources and frameworks available for HPC system testing.
1. Gather a collection of tests for different scientific applications and benchmarks that can be shared among the HPC community.

As a follow-up a BOF titled [HPC System Testing: Procedures, Acceptance, Regression Testing, and Automation](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=bof195&sess=sess324) was held during [SC19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/). Information gathered at the event as well as the slides presented during the lightning talks can be found [here](https://olcf.github.io/system-test-wg/events/sc19bof.html).

If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or send a PR.
