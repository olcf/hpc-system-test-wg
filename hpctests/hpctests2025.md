# HPCTESTS 2025

## Third International Workshop on HPC Testing and Evaluation of Systems, Tools, and Software

[https://olcf.github.io/hpc-system-test-wg/hpctests/hpctests2025](https://olcf.github.io/hpc-system-test-wg/hpctests/hpctests2025)

## Details

* **When**: Held in conjunction with [SC25](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/) in St. Louis, Mo, USA.

## Description

The HPCTESTS workshop brings together HPC researchers, operators, and vendors from around the globe to present and discuss state-of-the-art HPC system testing methodologies, tools, benchmarks, procedures, and best practices. The increasing complexity of HPC architectures and growing need to leverage HPC for integrated workflows more extensive testing than ever in order to thoroughly evaluate the status of the system after installation or a software upgrade and ensure proper operation before it is transitioned to production. Different methodologies are used to evaluate systems during their lifetime, not only at the beginning during the installation, but also during maintenance windows and alongside regular operations. This workshop provides a venue to present and discuss the latest HPC system testing technologies and methodologies.

The event will include an opening talk focused on current HPC system testing topics, followed by a series of paper presentations from peer-reviewed accepted submissions and concluding with a panel discussion.

## Call for Papers

**The Call for Paper will be issued soon!** Until then, please see [HPCTESTS 2024](https://olcf.github.io/hpc-system-test-wg/hpctests/hpctests2024)


### Paper Submissions

The workshop will publish its proceedings with the SC25 conference. Authors must follow the formatting guidelines from SC25 Papers which are available [here](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/program/papers/). Submissions can be 5-10 two-column pages (U.S. letter – 8.5 inches x 11 inches), excluding the bibliography, using the ACM proceedings template. Latex users, please use the “sigconf” option (use of the “review” option is recommended but not required). Word authors can use the “Interim Layout”. See the templates [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).  
Please also note the reproducibility initiative, which we follow for HPCTESTS.

Submissions will be accepted through the SC25 Submissions site: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/). After you create an account, you will be able to submit to the HPCTESTS 2025 form.
