## Details
* **When**: 08:30 - 12:00 ET on Friday, November 22, 2024, held in conjunction with [SC24](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/).
* **Where**: Room B309, Georgia World Congress Center (Atlanta, Goeorgia, USA)

## Description
The Second International Workshop on HPC Testing and Evaluation of Systems, Tools, and Software (HPCTESTS) will bring together experts from high performance computing (HPC) centers around the globe to present and discuss state-of-the-art HPC system testing methodologies, tools, and best practices. The workshop will encourage submissions that highlight current benchmarks, tests, and procedures utilized in today’s HPC systems. This event will provide an avenue to showcase newly developed tools and methodologies, as well as those that are being actively designed to allow authors to gather feedback from the community that could help guide their project. As machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) become more prevalent workloads, HPC centers must provide a wider range of services and more robust and resilient resources in order to support both traditional HPC and ML/DL workloads. The workshop will also invite submissions that are looking ahead at the post-exascale future of HPC system testing to help the community think of alternate mechanisms that could be used to adapt to the evolving and emerging workloads. The event will invite and welcome international participation from HPC centers, academic institutions, as well as representatives from vendors in the supercomputing space.

The event will include a keynote focused on current HPC system testing topics, followed by a series of paper presentations from peer-reviewed accepted submissions, and will conclude with a panel discussion.

The Second International Workshop on HPC Testing and Evaluation of Systems, Tools, and Software (HPCTESTS) will bring together experts from high performance computing (HPC) centers around the globe to present and discuss state-of-the-art HPC system testing methodologies, tools, and best practices. The workshop will encourage submissions that highlight current benchmarks, tests, and procedures utilized in today’s HPC systems. This event will provide an avenue to showcase newly developed tools and methodologies, as well as those that are being actively designed to allow authors to gather feedback from the community that could help guide their project. As machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) become more prevalent workloads, HPC centers must provide a wider range of services and more robust and resilient resources in order to support both traditional HPC and ML/DL workloads. The workshop will also invite submissions that are looking ahead at the post-exascale future of HPC system testing to help the community think of alternate mechanisms that could be used to adapt to the evolving and emerging workloads. The event will invite and welcome international participation from HPC centers, academic institutions, as well as representatives from vendors in the supercomputing space.

In addition to discussing procedures and tools utilized, submissions can describe challenges, lessons learned, and best practices used for regression testing, acceptance testing, and hardware evaluations. Furthermore, the workshop aims to encourage submissions that explore testbed evaluations as a means to gather preliminary results on system readiness to assist system design and deployment efforts.

This half-day workshop will kick-off with a keynote focused on novel HPC system testing techniques. The keynote will be followed by a series of paper talks selected from the open call for submissions that will be held. The workshop will conclude with a panel discussing key concepts impacting HPC system testing and related topics.

The workshop description, programming committee, Call for Papers (CFP), papers, and presentations will be archived in the HPC System Test Working Group website (https://olcf.github.io/hpc-system-test-wg/) under a new dedicated section for the HPCTESTS workshop.

Due to the wide range of systems currently in production and the rapidly evolving landscape of supercomputer architectures, the community should leverage individual center efforts to develop a collaborative set of best practices that will evolve from the publication of current tools, tests, and benchmarks. The diversity of architectures compounded with the distinct user workloads supported at each center, has resulted in each HPC center developing their own mechanisms, tests, benchmarks, and tools to conduct acceptance and regression testing. In this venue, we hope to attract stakeholders from vendors, HPC center staff, students, and faculty interested in exploring HPC system testing topics in depth. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Testing methodologies and procedures
- Tools for regression testing, frameworks
- Automation of testing and continuous regression testing and performance monitoring
- Selection and development of proxy-applications, benchmarks, synthetic vs. real applications
- Efforts to improve reproducibility, sustainability, and availability of tests that can be leveraged by the community
- Hardware and component focused testing (compute, memory, network, storage) at all scales from a single server (CPU/GPU) to clusters and cloud environments
- System software, programming languages, library testing
- Monitoring and analysis of tests results
- Best practices and lessons learned
- Early failure detection and/or classification using ML approaches
- Benchmark and testing for emerging technologies (e.g., quantum computing, ML/AI)


### Paper Submissions
The workshop will publish its proceedings with the SC24 conference. Authors must follow the formatting guidelines from SC24 Papers which are available [here](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/program/papers/). Submissions can be 5-10 two-column pages (U.S. letter – 8.5 inches x 11 inches), excluding the bibliography, using the IEEE proceedings template. The IEEE conference proceeding templates for LaTeX and MS Word provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the templates [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Submissions will be accepted through the SC24 Submissions site: [https://submissions.supercomputing.org/](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/). After you create an account, you will be able to submit to the HPCTESTS 2024 form.
